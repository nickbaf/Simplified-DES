<br>Project for the cource <b><i>Network Security</b></i> for the Academic Year 2016-2017

Simplified DES, developed by Professor Edward Schaefer of Santa Clara University, is an educational rather than a secure encryption algorithm. It has
similar properties and structure to DES with much smaller parameters. The S-DES encryption algorithm takes an 8-bit block of plaintext and a 10-bit key as input and produces an 8-bit block of cipher text as output. The S-DES decryption algorithm takes an 8-bit block of cipher text and the same 10-bit key used to produce that cipher text as input and produces the original 8-bit block of plaintext. 

 <br><br><br> The project was succesfully evaluated in February 2017 with score <b>2 /2</b>
